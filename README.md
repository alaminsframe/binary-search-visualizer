# Binary Search Visualization

This is a simple project that visually demonstrates how the **Binary Search** algorithm works. It was built using only **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN), making it lightweight and easy to run in any modern browser.

## 📖 About the Project

While learning the Binary Search algorithm, I initially struggled to understand how it iterates through a sorted array fully. After watching a few tutorials, I realized that visualizing the process could make the concept clearer. So, using my Tailwind and JS skills, I built this binary search visualization project through Vibe Coding.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Markup structure
- **JavaScript** – Binary search logic and DOM manipulation
- **Tailwind CSS** – Styling via CDN

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the project:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.

That’s it! No installation or build steps required.

## 🧠 Features

- Step-by-step visualization of the binary search process
- Highlighting of middle, left, and right pointers
- Simple, clean UI using Tailwind CSS
